</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>▢Squeeze some lemons, you will need 1.5 tblspn of lemon juice, line a sieve with muslin cloth and place it over a big bowl.</li>
       <li> ▢Take milk in a pot and put it on high heat. Let it come to a boil. Once it boils, take it off the heat and let it sit for 1 min.</li>
        <li>▢Now add in lemon juice and mix gently. The milk will curdle. Once a greenish whey separates from the milk and the milk solids have curdled completely. Strain it in the sieve.</li>
        <li>▢Now take a big bowl of cold water and wash the chenna well. rinse it in three changes of water.</li>
        <li>▢Now squeeze it gently with your hands to remove any excess whey water, Tie a knot and hang it over a tap and leave it to drain for 30 mins. I squeezed occasionally to make things faster.</li>
        <li>▢After 30 mins, take the chenna in a bowl and knead it gently, by rubbing with your palms and knuckles till you get a soft dough.</li>
       <li>▢Once a dough is soft, take a small portion from it and roll it in your palms gently till you get a smooth ball.</li>
       <li>▢Repeat with the remaining dough as well.</li>
       <li>▢Now take sugar and water in a big pot and mix well so the sugar is melted. Once the sugar is melted, put it on stove and let it come to a rolling boil.</li>
       <li>▢Now drop the balls into the sugar water and cover it with a tight lid and cook it for 8 to 10 mins till the ball has tripled in volume.</li>
        <li>▢Now take it off the heat and let it sit for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>▢Now open the lid and transfer it to a bowl and chill it for 5 to 6 hours.</li>
